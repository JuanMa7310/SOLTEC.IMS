**SOLTEC.IMS** (**Integrated Management System**). The concept refers to a type of software that allows the
integration of processes, systems and tools that combine and coordinate several management systems, such as
**Quality Management** (**QMS**), **Occupational Health and Safety Management** (**OHSMS**),
**Environmental Management** (**EMS**), **Risk Management** and **Information Management**, among others.
The main objective of an **IMS** is to ensure consistency and effectiveness in the implementation of policies and 
procedures in different areas of the organization.
By definition, it standardizes workflows, improving operational efficiency and increasing the productivity of the
*Human Resources* team, which is achieved through a unified view of data and the automation of processes.
